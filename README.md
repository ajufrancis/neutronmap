Neutron Map
===========

A very simple web application to visualize OpenStack Neutron topologies.

Neutron networks are represented with the [D3.js][d3js] library. The goal is to provide a logical view of the virtual resources, as well as a representation of the way these resources are allocated on physical hosts (not implemented yet).

You can get detailed information by double-clicking on each topology element.
